<h2>About us</h2>
<p>
Raman Sports Academy offers Online and Offline football coaching for kids and Fitness coaching for adults in Bangalore comprising of a set of highly professional and qualified trainers.
Time and again we have seen talented Indian footballers unable to reach the next level of the global game of football - mostly due to lack of a sound development system rather than the shortage of talent. Several experts have also gone on record saying that there is no dearth of football talent in India. However, in order to realize its full potential, this talent must be nurtured in the right way. Raman Sports Academy was started with an aim to plug this gap so that we can provide a world-class platform wherein talented young footballers can hone their talent under the right guidance.</p>

We, at RSA, bring you the latest coaching methodologies for our budding football stars. Our personal feedback system ensures a fun and exciting environment of learning for our students. We help our students to improve according to their individual needs by keeping a low kids-to-coach ratio. The exercises involve the latest equipment and training plans focused on holistic development of our young players under a system that combines all aspects of the beautiful game - technical, tactical, physical, mental and social.</p>

Raman Sports academy runs under the philosophy that no talented Indian kid should be deprived of the best football coaching facilities in the country due to monetary reasons. We are an all-inclusive venture and offer special schemes for worthy candidates from economically vulnerable backgrounds, who are personally screened by the RSA team. As much as 30% of the enrolled students at RSA are targeted to be from the underprivileged section of the society. Needy and talented children from various age groups are offered scholarships of up to 100% so that they get an opportunity to get the best out of their talent
